# Week 1 – Emission Data Cleaning & Visualization

 The task involved working on a dataset of **Supply Chain Emission Factors for US Industries (2016)**.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

1. **Data Loading**  
   The Excel file `SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities2.xlsx` was loaded using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Rows with null values in the `Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries` column were removed.
   - Duplicate rows were also removed.

3. **Data Analysis**  
   - Emissions were aggregated by industry.
   - The top 10 industries with the highest emissions were identified.

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - A **bar chart** shows the top 10 industries with the highest emissions.
   - A **histogram** illustrates the overall emission distribution across all industries.

## 📊 Output Files

- `top_10_industries_emissions.png`: Bar chart of top emitters.
- `emission_distribution_histogram.png`: Histogram of emission distribution.
